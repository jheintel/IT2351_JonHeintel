7.
  a) The variables with value under the DDL commands are create_db and create_table. 
     There is 1 under the db and 34 under the table because those are the databases currently being used
     by me when I write my scripts in mySQL. I could achieve the same results by creating the DBs on the fly
     when I start scripting.
  b) The variables with value under general are change_db, flush, select, and set_option
	change_db is a record of how many times ive switched DBs
	select is how many select statements I've queried the server
	set_option is i believe how many times I've set a variable
	and flush is the number of times I've cleared the cashe which I don't remember doing.

8. General log is a log of everything that happens in the open session of mySql. Currently I have the 
   general log set to OFF but I think that is standard unless you are looking for something 
   specifically. general_log_file is just the name of the file for the current session. mine is named 
   after the server, which I belive is also default.

9. Status variables let you know how the current open session is running and details about it 
   while system variables are concerned with the persistant between session variables.
